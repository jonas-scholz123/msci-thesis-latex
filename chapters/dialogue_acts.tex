%\chapter[Dialogue Act Classification]{Improving Dialogue Act Classification}
%We have three aims:
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item Evaluate and improve existing automated dialogue act classification.
%    \item Evaluate and improve existing automated topic extraction method.
%    %\item Apply improved methods to a large number of conversations to determine the (statistical) ``bounds" of conversations.
%    \item Apply the improved methods to a large number of conversations to easily enable future work actually analysing said conversations.
%\end{enumerate}

\gls{da} classification is an active area of research, because it helps speech controlled devices (such as Google Home or Amazon Alexa) identify what the user wants\cite{daApplications}. We select an existing hierarchical bi-directional \gls{lstm} \gls{model} by Kumar et al.\cite{kumar2017dialogue} (for the reasons explained in Sec. \ref{sssec: kumar model}) and modernise it.

%Sections ??? to ??? describes our methods and findings for the first aim, sections ??? to ??? for the second.
