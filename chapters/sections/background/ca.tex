\section{Conversation Analysis \label{sec: ca}}

The analysis of the structure of conversations falls within the field of \textit{conversation analysis} (CA), a sub-field of linguistics. This section explores the key concepts from CA that we use for our work. 
% CONVERSATION ANALYSIS FIRST
    \subsection{Utterances \label{ssec: utterances}}
        Within conversations, utterances are strings of words that begin and end with a clear pause. As an approximation, we are assuming that every utterance corresponds to a sentence and in this thesis, sentences and utterances are considered synonyms.
    \subsection{Dialogue Acts \label{ssec: DAs}}
        The atomic unit within CA is the \textit{dialogue act} (DA) (also known as \textit{speech act} outside the context of conversations). The DA describes the \textit{action} of an utterance. DAs can be split into categories such as questions, greetings, statements of politeness, statements of agreement etc. for our work, we use the SWBD-DAMSL tag-set of 42 dialogue acts featured in the SwDa corpus (see Sec. \ref{ssec: swda})\cite{fang2012annotation, swda}. The most common dialogue acts as well as their relative frequency is shown in table \ref{table: damsl das}.

            \textbf{SWBD-DAMSL}          & \textbf{Example}                                & \textbf{\%} \\ \hline
            Statement-non-opinion        & Me, I'm in the legal department.                & 36\%        \\ \hline
            Acknowledge (Backchannel)    & Uh-huh.                                         & 19\%        \\ \hline
            Statement-opinion            & I think it's great                              & 13\%        \\ \hline
            Agree/Accept                 & That's exactly it.                              & 5\%         \\ \hline

            Wh-Question                  & Well, how old are you?                          & 1\%         \\ \hline

            Affirmative non-yes answers  & It is.                                          & .4\%        \\ \hline

    \subsection{Adjacency Pairs \label{ssec: adjacency pairs}}
        
        In a conversation, speech acts are part of a greater cohesive structure. In CA, this is the structure of \textit{adjacency pairs}. Adjacency pairs are pairs of speech acts $(s_j, s_{j+1})$, in which the initial speech act with label $s_j$ is replied to by the response with label $s_{j+1}$. Examples include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (question, answer)
            \item (greeting, greeting)
            \item (request, denial)
            \item (opinion, agreement) etc.
        \end{itemize}
    
        A conversation, on the utterance level, is structured as a long string of such adjacency pairs.
