\section{Neural Networks for Text Analysis \label{sec: NNs for text}}
    There are two key issues with using \glspl{nn} for text-analysis:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \glspl{nn} do not speak English. We need to translate the inputs into a language (of numbers) that computers can work with. 

    \item \glspl{nn} require equal-length inputs, but words and sentences can have variable lengths.
    
    %A simple map such as $a \rightarrow 1, b \rightarrow 2 \dots$ also does not work, because the letters making up words do not inherently contain information or carry meaning - the meaning of a word is defined by the language in which it is written. In the same way that a Spanish word carries no meaning to a non-Spanish speaker, computer does not speak english
    \end{enumerate}
    The first issue is addressed by word-\glspl{embedding} (Sec. \ref{ssec: word embeddings}), the second by
    \glspl{rnn}.
