\chapter{Analysing Conversations}
Initially, it was our aim to analyse conversations with pre-built \gls{nlp} tools. However, a lot of the tools that work in general \gls{nlp} fail when applied explicitly to conversations. Thus, the focus of our work shifted from \textbf{using} \gls{nlp} techniques to \textbf{improving} (specialising) them. This section could therefore be significantly expanded in future work and in its current form is only useful as an example of analysis that our tools enable.
