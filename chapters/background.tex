\chapter{Background \label{cpt: background}}

Our analysis is based on concepts from the \gls{ca}, a sub-field of linguistics, and is automated using tools and techniques from the \gls{nlp} area of computer science. This chapter first introduces all the \gls{nlp} concepts and tools used within this work (Sec. \ref{sec: nlp} to \ref{ssec: word embeddings}) and then the linguistic concepts that our specific analysis is built on (Sec. \ref{sec: ca})
%and finally introduces work directly related to our project (Sec. ???).
