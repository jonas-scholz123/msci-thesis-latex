\chapter[Topic Extraction]{Improving Topic Extraction}
The second technique we improve is topic extraction --- determining \textit{which} topics are addressed in a conversation and \textit{when}. In this chapter, we evaluate a number of usual topic modelling techniques within the context of conversations, determine key weaknesses and develop a novel topic extraction method that is more robust against these key weaknesses.
