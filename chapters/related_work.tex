% TODO: Change, no longer doing actual analysis
While to our knowledge no work exists that statistically analyses conversations on a large scale, the methods of analysis that we employ are common and well established. The first part of our analysis, in which we analyse a conversation as a string of many small \glspl{da} rests on \gls{da} classification and is addressed in Sec. \ref{ssec: da classification}. The second part of our analysis, which is concerned with analysing conversations as a trajectory through a semantic topic-space, uses topic modelling. Previous topic modelling work is explored in Sec. \ref{sec: topic analysis} -- \ref{ssec: topic labelling}.
