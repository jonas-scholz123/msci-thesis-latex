\chapter{Existing Work}

While to our knowledge no work exists that statistically analyses conversations on a large scale, the methods of analysis that we employ are common and well established. The first part of our analysis, in which we analyse a conversation as a string of many small dialogue acts rests on dialogue act classification and is addressed in Sec. \ref{ssec: da classification}. The second part of our analysis, which is concerned with analysing conversations as a trajectory through a semantic topic-space, uses topic modelling. Previous topic modelling work is explored in Sec. \ref{sec: topic analysis} - \ref{ssec: topic labelling}.
