% TODO: Change, no longer doing actual analysis
%While to our knowledge no work exists that statistically analyses conversations on a large scale, the methods of analysis that we employ are common and well established. The first part of our analysis, in which we analyse a conversation as a string of many small \glspl{da} rests on \gls{da} classification and is addressed in Sec. \ref{ssec: da classification}. The second part of our analysis, which is concerned with analysing conversations as a trajectory through a semantic topic-space, uses topic modelling. Previous topic modelling work is explored in Sec. \ref{sec: topic analysis} -- \ref{ssec: topic labelling}.

In this chapter we introduce previous work within the well-established and active field of \textbf{\gls{da} classification} and within the less active area of \textbf{topic extraction}. We later build upon these methods to build state of the art algorithms within both areas. 
Methods for \gls{da} classification, in which sentences are automatically matched to their \glspl{da} (e.g. "Hello!" $\rightarrow$ greeting, see Sec. \ref{ssec: DAs}), are introduced in Sec. \ref{ssec: da classification}.

Existing methods for topic modelling, which finds out \textit{which} topics are featured within a conversation and \textit{when}, are introduced in Sec. \ref{sec: topic analysis} -- \ref{ssec: topic labelling}.
