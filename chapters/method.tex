\chapter{Evaluating Existing Methods For Conversations}
Our aims fall into two categories:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Evaluate and improve existing automated conversation analysis methods.
    \item Apply improved methods to a large number of conversations to determine the (statistical) ``bounds" of conversations.
\end{enumerate}
This chapter describes our methods and findings for the first aim.
